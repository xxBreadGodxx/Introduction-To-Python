# Introduction To Python

This introduction to Python was created to help my friend get into the world of programming.

There is a lot that can be done better in this course, clearly left to the imagination for those who have or have never touched programming before.

I do not claim to be an expert who knows everything, but I hope this serves as an easy introduction to Python (at least in my eyes).

Depending on how things go, this course might be updated or have new additions as my friend learns.

As of writing this, there are only three lessons, as follows:

Lesson 1: Introduction Topics - Print Statements, If-Else Statements, and User Input.

Lesson 2: Calculations with Mathematics & User Input (I also added a fun login feature to demonstrate the basics of if-else/user input statements).

Lesson 3: Introduction to File Handling & Importing Packages.

I've tried my best to be as clear and concise as possible with these lessons. The first lesson does not include many definitions, as I thought most of it was self-explanatory. If something doesn't make sense, I suggest either checking Stack Overflow threads or reaching out on my GitHub.

The rest of the lessons, however, are very detailed and down-to-earth. I try to help the learner understand what certain concepts mean in a more practical sense, as well as break them down.

Again, I stress that I am not a programming wizard who knows all or sees all. Some of my definitions are based on my experience and how I've programmed over the last seven years. They may not be by the book, but they help in understanding what does what.

If you are new to programming and see this as an opportunity to jump into something unknown and new, I highly recommend taking the leap of faith and diving in. Programming has been a great outlet for me to relieve boredom and satisfy my curiosity about how things work. If you want to try something new, start with Python.
